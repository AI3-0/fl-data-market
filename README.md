# fl-data-market

### Three entities: data buyer, data seller, data aggregator

+ Data marketplace where any data-owning entity (individuals, companies, governments, research organizations) can list their data for sale without worrying about privacy, labeling, or copyright issues.

+ Buyers of data (ML companies, research organizations, hedge funds, governments, individuals) who need the data to train their models can buy the data to train their models for efficiency without having to worry about privacy, copyright, labeling, and dataset efficiency issues.

+ Crypto (our native token)  will be used to provide incentives for data-owning entities to list their data for sale and create data-managing firms that specialize in sourcing data opportunities from across the globe.
